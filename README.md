# housing-prediction-project
A machine learning project to predict the prices of the houses in the california region.
This is the end to end project where i have used DOCKER to create continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline and i have deployed it over the heroku platform 

# Objective
 We have the dataset of california housing society where the features are given below
 
 Columns:
    
	Longitude
 
	Latitude
 
	housing_median_age
 
	total_room
	
	population
	
	total_bedroom
	
	households
	
	median_income
	
	median_house_value
	
	ocean_proximity

Now, The objective is to create a machine learning model which can predict prices of the houses in the particular region
